# This is a placeholder file to demonstrate how Row Level Security (RLS) policies should be set up.
# The actual policies should be created in the Supabase dashboard or via SQL migrations.

# Example policy for students table
# CREATE POLICY "Teachers can view their own students"
# ON public.students
# FOR SELECT
# USING (teacher_id = auth.uid());

# CREATE POLICY "Teachers can insert their own students"
# ON public.students
# FOR INSERT
# WITH CHECK (teacher_id = auth.uid());

# CREATE POLICY "Teachers can update their own students"
# ON public.students
# FOR UPDATE
# USING (teacher_id = auth.uid());

# CREATE POLICY "Teachers can delete their own students"
# ON public.students
# FOR DELETE
# USING (teacher_id = auth.uid());
